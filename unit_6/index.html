				<p class="excerpt">The humble potato occupies a special place in Belarusian cooking and culture - featuring in numerous dishes, and even in the well-known traditional folk song and dance “Bulba” (Potato).Perhaps ironically, one of the dishes I most fondly remember from my three visits to Belarus features the potato in a supporting, rather than a starring, role.
